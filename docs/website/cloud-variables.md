# Cloud Variables

TurboWarp has its own cloud variable server independent of Scratch.

Some things to keep in mind:

 - Yes, this changes is by oficial Mr.Cha
 - Cloud variables are disabled when the editor is opened.
 - Do not abuse cloud variables to make unmoderated chat rooms.
 - There are no public cloud variable history logs.
